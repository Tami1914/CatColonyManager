# Cat Colony Manager

We want to create an application that allows us to store information about the different cat shelters operating in the various Canary Islands.
Each shelter must record a name and a unique identifier for unambiguous identification, as well as its address, the employees (at least one), and at least two of the cats available for adoption.
They also want to store information about the cats that have been adopted, and these must always have the adopter's name associated. There may be shelters where no adoptions have taken place yet, and the same adopter may have adopted more than one cat.
They want to know the adopter's name, their address (street, town, and postal code), and their phone number (mobile and landline; not necessarily both, but always one).
From the employees, we want to store the same data as that of the adopter, in addition to their social security number, which we will use to identify the employee.
For the cats available for adoption, we want to know their approximate age, breed, name, identifier, and time in the shelter.

Initially appeared on
[gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.

## Getting Started

The cat_shelters.xml document will use the information we have entered to store and validate it, allowing us easy access to this information.

All we need to do is copy the code from the cat_shelters.xml file and paste it into a file we have previously created on our computer. The new file must have the same name and extension, "cat_shelters.xml".

We do the same with the 'cat_shelters.dtd' file. This will allow us to ensure that the 'cat_shelters.xml' file is valid. With all of this, we will be able to store information about the cat shelters in our area.
